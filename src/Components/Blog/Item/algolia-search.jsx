              Integrating Algolia Search with Asp .NET
            </h3>
            <p className="text-xl text-white text-justify">
              Recently, we've built an e-commerce platform at Astha-IT for APEX
              is the largest footwear brand in Bangladesh. We chose Algolia to
              search for products, here's a fun fact, the client is also
              familiar with Algolia search. We've also successfully built many
              applications but none of them have integrated Algolia. This is the
              first time, we've had a challenge to implement it. We have a big
              advantage of using Algolia with .NET projects is that they already
              have robust SDKs in Dot NET.
            </p>
            <p className="mt-10 text-xl text-white text-justify">
              Typically, there are three main steps to integrate Algolia into a
              project:
              <ol className="mt-5">
                <li>1. Indexing your data</li>
                <li>2. Optimizing your data relevance</li>
                <li>
                  3. Building your front-end search experience We just need to
                  form data into a way, to throw all of our searchable data into
                  a JSON file, push it up to Algolia, and call it a day.
                </li>
              </ol>
              <br />
              At first, we had to find the keywords for which Algolia would
              search and the filters that would be used to filter search
              results. As our goal was to search and filter footwear products,
              here come some challenges with product searching, brand, category,
              style, color, and size-wise filtering. So, in order to best serve
              our global navigation search along with our other search UIs
              (think: people directories), we decided that we really only needed{" "}
              <b>one global index</b>.
            </p>
            <p className="mt-10 text-xl text-white text-justify">
              We would{" "}
              <a
                className="hover:text-orange-200 underline"
                href="https://www.algolia.com/doc/guides/managing-results/refine-results/filtering"
              >
                filter
              </a>{" "}
              and{" "}
              <a
                className="hover:text-orange-200 underline"
                href="https://www.algolia.com/doc/guides/managing-results/refine-results/faceting/"
              >
                facet
              </a>{" "}
              our records using their attributes. According to the plan, we had
              worked on that. After successfully indexing data, we could apply
              the searching and filtering. Still, we need to figure out the key
              points when each product indexing needs to be updated.
              <br /> Example:{" "}
              <ol>
                <li>1. Product update</li>
                <li>2. Category update</li>
                <li>3. Brand update etc....</li>
              </ol>{" "}
              and others. Although we've implemented these parts there was a
              major feature we were missing, that is parent-child relations for
              product searching.
